# Code-Quiz

#User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

#Motivators and what I learned

The reason as to why I created this project is because I wanted to further hone my skills with JavaScript and how the coding language adds interactivity to a website.

I learned the importance and versatility of functions, objects, variables, etc.

#Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
